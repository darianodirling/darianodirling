ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Darian O'Dirling! I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at East Carolina University, with a passion for network security, cloud computing, and cybersecurity research. Alongside my studies, I've gained practical experience in Python, Java, C++, SQL, and Cisco IOS, with a focus on designing innovative solutions to complex problems.

ðŸ’» I have had the opportunity to intern at Cisco, where I contributed as a Technical Consulting Engineer and later as a Global Intern Ambassador, mentoring fellow engineers and creating valuable content for Cisco's global community. I've also worked on hands-on cybersecurity research at ECU, setting up labs and simulating attacks to gather insights on network vulnerabilities.

ðŸ”§ My technical toolkit includes certifications in AWS Cloud Computing and Salesforce. I'm also working towards my CCNA and CompTIA Security+ certifications to deepen my understanding of network infrastructure and cyber defense strategies.

ðŸš€ When I'm not coding or researching, I volunteer as a YoungLife leader, where I lead events and serve my community.
